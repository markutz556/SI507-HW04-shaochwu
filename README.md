Part 1: Using Github and Creating Magic Eight Ball code (20pts)
Find a partner and sign up your pairing here.		

There are (at least) two roles:
Person A
Person B

You're encouraged to work on this together, side-by-side, and talk through both/all parts!

The instructions here are written in terms that are sometimes general and sometimes git-specific. For the general instructions, you will need to figure out how to translate the common-sense description into the appropriate git commands (of course taking advantages of all of the usual channels for getting help).

PERSON A:
Create a directory on your personal computer and have git start tracking it.
Create a magic_eight.py file 
Create a function that asks users “What is your question?” (or something similar) and saves the response.
Create a repository on GitHub for your work, called SI507-HW04-(uniquename).
Add Person B (and C) as a collaborator 
Connect your GitHub repository to your local 

PERSON B:
Get the repository
Create a new branch called “add_questions”
In the magic_eight.py file add code to pick an answer at random from the 20 possible 8 ball answers.
Push your new code *and branch* to GitHub. 

PERSON A:
Create a new branch called “check_question”
Write code that checks if user input is a question (i.e., ends in a ‘?’) and, if not, prints “I’m sorry, I can only answer questions.” (or something similar)
Edit the program so that it keeps asking for user input until the user inputs “quit”
Get your changes onto GitHub

PERSON B:
Get the latest code from GitHub
Merge your branch into the master branch
Get your changes back onto GitHub

PERSON A:
Get the latest code from GitHub
Merge your branch into the master branch (after Person B has completed merge)
Get your changes back onto GitHub

PERSON A+B:
Pull the master branch and verify that everything works
